## Travel Journal

## heroku - https://mae-project-journal.herokuapp.com/user 

## About the app: 

This app is built for people who travel and would like to share their experiences with their friends/family/etc. Users will be able to load enteries and also gives them a template to where they visited.

## Technologies Used:


    - HTML
    - React
    - Express
    - Javascript 
    - CSS 
    - MongDB



## Approach: 

I wanted to make a simple layout with easy navigations. Something where an entry could be found by the date or sorted by the location visited.


## Things to revist

1: Add a feature that saves the user's location -- kinda like what Google maps currently offers

2: A better layout

3: A functionality that gets users to upload photos and able to share experiences (user code).

## Challenges: 

-- Biggest challenge was connecting the JSX files to one another. For example, when someone is on editing an entry and having it be shown in the Index page.
